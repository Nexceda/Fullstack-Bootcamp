    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Technical Hobbies</h2>
    <p>For most of my life, I've known that IT was very suited for me. I loved digging into the nitty gritty of the windows filesystem and played around with Linux at an early age. Thus, alot of my hobbies are Technical. I self administrate my own homelab with various private and public services on a myriad of operating systems utilizing cloudflare dns, NGINX reverse proxy, Proxmox, Unraid, Postgresql Databases, and more. Currently I'm going through a 60 hour Full Stack Development bootcamp to add onto my current skillsets as well as aid in my primary profession of Cybersecurity Analysis. </p>
    <h2>Outside of IT</h2>
    <p>Outside of IT, there is still a lot I like to do. I grew up dancing and you can still frequently find me dancing around my apartment practicing old routines from my 14 years in dance company. I also grew up singing and I recently have started learning to play electric guitar as a result of my obsession with MetalCore music. When I have the space again, I'll be throwing myself back in to custom car modification and performance work on my 2000 Z28 Camaro.</p>
